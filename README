ZIMReader in Java
=================

    This is a port of the ZIMReader in Java. One 
    of the aims of this project is to enable mobile 
    users developing on Android, J2ME and other 
    platforms to use ZIM files and build offline 
    Wikipedia readers.

    I'll soon add a javadoc, in the mean time 
    you can go through the comments that I have 
    provided in the source code. Also, try running 
    the example ZIMTest.java. 

    This code was built on Java 1.6 and has not 
    been tested on previous versions. However, I'll
    do that soon on previous ones as well. In the 
    next release, I intend to provide an Ant file.

    If you find any bugs, please report them to 
    <aruneshmathur1990  at  gmail.com> or visit the 
    IRC channel #openzim on Freenode and ping 
    'gremmachook'.
    
    This library is licensed under the LGPL v3.0 
    license. However, I understand that sometimes 
    licensing can be a problem for you. I would be 
    happy to provide a alternate lesser permissive 
    license if the need be.

    Found this library useful? Drop in a mail, I 
    love to hear feedback.

    Before this ends, I'd like to thank Lasse Collin 
    <Lasse.collin at tukaani.org>, who maintains the 
    Tukaani project, for his port of XZ in Java, 
    without which it wouldn't have been possible for 
    me to write this library.
